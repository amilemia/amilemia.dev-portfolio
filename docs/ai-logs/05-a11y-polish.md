**Branch:** dev

## Prompt (verbatim)

Context pack
Project: amilemia.dev — Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4, shadcn (installed), sonner, Zod, Resend, contentlayer2/next-contentlayer2.
State: Pages & routing shipped (Home, Projects, [slug], About, Contact). Contact API wired. Using Tailwind v4 (no @tailwindcss/typography). We want a small polish pass (a11y + consistent spacing/typography) WITHOUT adding new deps.
Constraints: a11y AA, keyboard focus visible, dark mode respected, minimal readable diffs.

Goal: Add light design tokens + accessibility polish and prose-like MDX styling (no typography plugin).

Tasks
1) Components
   - Create src/components/Container.tsx  with a responsive max-width wrapper (default: mx-auto w-full max-w-6xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 ).
   - Create src/components/Section.tsx  for vertical spacing sections (py-12 sm:py-16  + optional as  prop).
   - Create src/components/a11y/VisuallyHidden.tsx  (screen-reader-only span).
   - Create src/components/a11y/SkipLink.tsx  that links to #main-content  and becomes visible on focus.

2) Layout updates
   - In src/app/layout.tsx , add <SkipLink />  at the top of <body> .
   - Ensure the main content wrapper has id="main-content" .
   - Keep <Toaster />  at the end of <body> .
   - Use Container  + Section  in Home and Projects pages where appropriate (small diff).

3) Global CSS polish (edit src/app/globals.css )
   - Add a base focus-visible style using CSS vars from shadcn tokens:
     ```
     :where(a,button,input,textarea,select,[role="button"]):focus-visible {
       outline: 2px solid hsl(var(--ring));
       outline-offset: 2px;
     }
     ```
   - Add a minimal “prose-like” style (no plugin). Provide class .prose  that styles headings, paragraphs, lists, code, blockquote, hr, table, and images with sensible spacing and readable line-height. Add .dark .prose  overrides for contrast (no excessive colors).
   - Add .sr-only  utility for VisuallyHidden if needed.
   - Add a prefers-reduced-motion  rule that reduces animation/transition durations.

4) Project detail page
   - Wrap the rendered MDX body in a <div className="prose dark:prose-invert">...</div>  and ensure images are responsive and have alt  text passed through when present.

5) External links
   - Ensure external links (e.g., footer GitHub) include target="_blank"  (where appropriate) and rel="noopener noreferrer" .

Output format
1) File list with one-line rationale per file
2) Full code blocks for each new/changed file
3) “Verification” section (commands + URLs)
4) “README notes” section (bullets to paste)

Acceptance criteria
- Skip link appears on tab (focus) and jumps to main content.
- Keyboard-only navigation shows visible focus outlines on all interactive elements.
- MDX content reads well with .prose  styles in both light and dark.
- Reduced-motion users don’t get long transitions/animations.
- No new dependencies; diffs are small and readable.
```

## AI Output (verbatim)
_Paste the full Windsurf response from this thread here._  
_Key excerpts you mentioned in chat:_
- Created **Container.tsx**, **Section.tsx**, **a11y/VisuallyHidden.tsx**, **a11y/SkipLink.tsx**.
- Updated **layout.tsx** to include `<SkipLink />`, ensured `<main id="main-content" tabIndex={-1}>`, kept `<Toaster />` at end.
- Added global focus-visible styles, reduced-motion rules, and custom **`.prose`** styles in **globals.css**.
- Wrapped project MDX body with `div.prose.dark:prose-invert` and ensured images are responsive with `alt` text.
- Applied **Container/Section** to Home, Projects, About, Contact pages.
- Ensured external links (e.g., footer GitHub) include `rel="noopener noreferrer"` (and `target="_blank"` where appropriate).
- Fixed skip-link visibility (initially not appearing): simplified `SkipLink` and added explicit CSS; verified it appears on `Tab` and jumps focus to main.

> IDE noise fixes (optional): added `.vscode/settings.json` and `.vscode/css_custom_data.json` to suppress warnings for Tailwind/PostCSS directives (`@apply`, `@theme`, `@custom-variant`).

## Changed Files (summary)
_Use `git show --name-status --oneline HEAD` to paste the exact list once committed._

Modified:
- `.gitignore` — appended rules (and normalize EOL if needed)
- `README.md` — appended “Step 5 — A11y & Design Polish” and AI usage note
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — added `<SkipLink />`, `id="main-content"` on `<main>`, focus handling
- `src/app/globals.css` — focus-visible outlines, reduced-motion, `.prose` styles, skip-link styles (revised)
- `src/app/page.tsx` — applied `Container`/`Section`
- `src/app/projects/page.tsx` — applied `Container`/`Section`
- `src/app/projects/[slug]/project-content.tsx` — ensured `.prose` wrapper & responsive media
- `src/app/about/page.tsx` — applied `Container`/`Section`, minor heading polish
- `src/app/contact/page.tsx` — applied `Container`/`Section`, form spacing

Added:
- `src/components/Container.tsx` — layout wrapper
- `src/components/Section.tsx` — vertical rhythm
- `src/components/a11y/VisuallyHidden.tsx` — screen-reader-only utility
- `src/components/a11y/SkipLink.tsx` — “Skip to main content” anchor
- `.vscode/settings.json` — suppress CSS at-rule warnings; enable Tailwind niceties
- `.vscode/css_custom_data.json` — register custom directives for IDE

## Verification
Commands run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Manual checks:
- **Skip link**: On first `Tab` from page top, “Skip to main content” appears; `Enter` moves focus to main. ✅  
- **Keyboard focus**: Visible outline on links, buttons, inputs across pages. ✅  
- **Project detail prose**: `/projects/hello-world` renders readable headings, paragraphs, lists, code; images responsive; works in dark mode. ✅  
- **Reduced motion**: With OS/browser “reduced motion” enabled, transitions are minimized. ✅  
- **External links**: Footer GitHub link opens in a new tab and has `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. ✅  

Notes (Windows/IDE):
- Git showed CRLF warnings while staging; safe to ignore (normalize later if desired).
- Tailwind/PostCSS directive warnings suppressed via `.vscode` config.

### Features Implemented (Step 5 — A11y & Design Polish)
- Skip link for keyboard users and main content landmark
- Consistent layout primitives: `Container` and `Section`
- Global focus-visible outlines using theme ring token
- Minimal prose-like MDX styles (light/dark) without extra plugins
- Reduced-motion support
- External link safety (`rel="noopener noreferrer"`)
```
AI Usage update:
```markdown
- **Windsurf (SWE-1):** produced small diffs for a11y polish (skip link, focus styles) and reusable layout primitives without adding dependencies.
```

## Takeaways
- Tiny a11y improvements (skip link, focus rings) have outsized UX impact for keyboard users.
- Custom `.prose` styles were sufficient; avoided new dependencies (typography plugin).
- Good to gate motion via `prefers-reduced-motion` and keep outlines consistent with theme `--ring` token.
- On Windows, npm install + git line-endings and IDE warnings are common; local `.vscode` config and CRLF awareness help.
- Changes were kept small and reviewable with clear verification steps.
