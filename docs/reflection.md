Working with AI throughout this build reshaped the rhythm of my workflow. Instead of staring at a blank editor, I began each task by describing the goal in conversational terms, trusting the assistant to translate that vision into scaffolds of code or checklists of actions. That shift compressed the exploratory phase: AI-generated summaries revealed project structure faster than manual spelunking, and automated reasoning identified dependencies I might have missed. The process felt like pair programming with a teammate who never tires, nudging me to focus on higher-level product questions while it surfaced implementation details and potential pitfalls.

The strongest payoff came when I used the model to review and refactor drafts. By pasting snippets back into the chat with prompts like "optimize the rendering loop but keep the animation API stable" or "explain why this accessibility warning fires," I received actionable advice. The assistant suggested graph visualizations, lint settings, and pointed to documentation I had overlooked. It was especially helpful at synthesizing feedback from multiple tools, fusing lint errors, test logs, and design specs into coherent checklists. That synthesis kept my focus and accelerated how fast I could ship.

Yet the collaboration exposed real constraints. The model occasionally hallucinated file paths or invented configuration flags, and I had to validate each suggestion against the repository. When instructions were broad, the assistant defaulted to generic boilerplate that missed subtle project conventions. I also noticed latency in longer conversations: context windows filled up quickly, forcing me to prune or restate details that felt obvious. Those friction points reminded me that AI is not a drop-in replacement for documentation or team consensus; it is a fluent but fallible partner whose confident tone can mask uncertainty.

Prompting evolved into its own craft. Early on I tossed out vague questions at the assistant and received surface-level responses. Over time I learned to supply constraints, articulate acceptance criteria, and chain directives together: first ask for a plan, then request code, then demand tests. That sequencing allowed me to audit the reasoning at each checkpoint and prevented subtle bugs from slipping through. I also leaned on role prompts, asking the AI to behave like a QA analyst or technical writer to elicit different perspectives. Each persona emphasized different risks, deepening my understanding.

Looking back, the most valuable lesson was to treat AI as a dynamic reviewer embedded in the feedback loop. I started logging its recommendations alongside human comments, which made retrospectives richer: we could track which suggestions were adopted, which were rejected, and why. That record highlighted gaps in my mental model, areas where the machine noticed patterns I ignored, or where I had to override its confident but incorrect guidance. The practice of iterating with the assistant honed my communication skills; I became more explicit about tradeoffs, more disciplined about testing, and more intentional about when to trust automation versus manual craftsmanship. Ultimately the collaboration didn't replace my judgment; it augmented it, giving me courage to experiment faster while staying accountable for the results achieved.
