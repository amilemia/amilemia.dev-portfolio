## üîñ Project Title & Description

**Title:** amilemia.dev ‚Äî Personal Web Developer Portfolio  
**What I‚Äôm building:** A fast, accessible portfolio that highlights my skills, selected projects (as detailed case studies), and a clear contact path.  
**Who it‚Äôs for:** Hiring managers, clients, and collaborators.  
**Why it matters:** A credible, thoughtfully structured portfolio demonstrates engineering quality (accessibility, testing, docs) and accelerates opportunities.

## üß† AI Integration Strategy

### Code Generation (Windsurf + Codex CLI)
- **How I‚Äôll use it:**  
  - Scaffold components, routes, and utilities from clear acceptance criteria.  
  - Generate small, reviewable diffs (component + test together).  
  - Enforce accessibility (keyboard focus, roles/labels) and TypeScript strict types in all prompts.
- **Sample prompts:**  
  - *‚ÄúCreate a `ProjectCard` component using shadcn/ui Card + Tailwind. Props must match this Zod schema. Include keyboard focus styles, ARIA where needed, and a Vitest + Testing Library spec. Provide a usage example in MDX.‚Äù*  
  - *‚ÄúGenerate `/app/api/contact/route.ts` with Zod validation `{ name: string; email: string; message: string; }`. On success send via Resend, else return typed error. Include unit tests for the validator and a Playwright e2e for happy/invalid cases.‚Äù*

### Testing Support
- **Unit/Component (Vitest + Testing Library):** Ask AI to cover render states, props, a11y roles/labels, and edge cases driven by Zod schemas.  
- **E2E (Playwright):** AI to script smoke flows (nav, project detail, contact form submission) and error paths.  
- **Sample prompts:**  
  - *‚ÄúGiven this Zod schema for ContactForm, write Vitest tests for valid/invalid inputs and error messages with Testing Library.‚Äù*  
  - *‚ÄúWrite a Playwright spec: open `/`, navigate to a project page, submit Contact form (valid/invalid), assert toast/error states and network responses.‚Äù*

### Documentation
- **Docstrings & Comments:** Use AI to add concise docstrings explaining component responsibilities, a11y choices, and validation flow.  
- **README & Page Copy:** Draft and refine section copy (hero, about, project case studies) for clarity and tone; ensure consistency with the codebase.  
- **Change notes:** On structural changes, generate short migration notes (what moved and why).

### Context-Aware Techniques
- **Provide context to AI:**  
  - File tree (or relevant subtree) and `package.json` dependencies.  
  - Zod schemas for forms/content to drive types, tests, and examples.  
  - Diff hunks for PR-sized modifications.  
  - Contentlayer config and MDX frontmatter to keep code/data aligned.  
- **API/Schema grounding:** When adding routes or external APIs, paste the schema/OpenAPI snippet so AI can produce typed helpers and contract tests.

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### Step 3 ‚Äî Pages & Routing
- App layout with accessible header navigation and footer
- Home page with hero, CTAs, and "Recent projects" (top 3 from Contentlayer2)
- Projects index with responsive grid and project cards
- Project detail pages rendering MDX content by slug (Contentlayer2 + App Router)
- About page with bio and highlights
- Contact page (UI only) with client-side Zod validation and inline errors

## ü§ñ AI Usage (so far)

- **Windsurf (SWE-1):** scaffolded pages/routing, header/footer, and form UI with a11y guardrails, using repo context and helpers.
- Changes delivered as small, reviewable diffs with verification steps and README notes.
