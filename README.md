## üß† AI Integration Strategy

### Code Generation (Windsurf + Codex CLI)
- **How I‚Äôll use it:**  
  - Scaffold components, routes, and utilities from clear acceptance criteria.  
  - Generate small, reviewable diffs (component + test together).  
  - Enforce accessibility (keyboard focus, roles/labels) and TypeScript strict types in all prompts.
  - **Windsurf (SWE-1):** used an OpenAPI spec to scaffold a typed client, demonstrating schema-aware generation.
- **Sample prompts:**  
  - *‚ÄúCreate a `ProjectCard` component using shadcn/ui Card + Tailwind. Props must match this Zod schema. Include keyboard focus styles, ARIA where needed, and a Vitest + Testing Library spec. Provide a usage example in MDX.‚Äù*  
  - *‚ÄúGenerate `/app/api/contact/route.ts` with Zod validation `{ name: string; email: string; message: string; }`. On success send via Resend, else return typed error. Include unit tests for the validator and a Playwright e2e for happy/invalid cases.‚Äù*

## üéØ Analytics & Tracking

### Events Tracked

- **Home Page**
  - `CTA: Start a project` - When clicking the main CTA button
  - `CTA: View work` - When clicking the secondary CTA button
  
- **Projects**
  - `Project: View` - When viewing a project detail page (includes slug and title)
  - `Projects: Filter` - When filtering projects by tag (debounced 300ms)
  
- **Contact**
  - `Contact: Submitted` - When successfully submitting the contact form (includes message length)

### Implementation Details

- All tracking is client-side only and gracefully degrades if Plausible is blocked
- No personal or sensitive data is tracked
- Uses a centralized `track()` utility for consistent event naming and properties
- Preconnects to Plausible for improved performance

### Testing Support
- **Unit/Component (Vitest + Testing Library):** Ask AI to cover render states, props, a11y roles/labels, and edge cases driven by Zod schemas.  
- **E2E (Playwright):** AI to script smoke flows (nav, project detail, contact form submission) and error paths.  
- **Sample prompts:**  
  - *‚ÄúGiven this Zod schema for ContactForm, write Vitest tests for valid/invalid inputs and error messages with Testing Library.‚Äù*  
  - *‚ÄúWrite a Playwright spec: open `/`, navigate to a project page, submit Contact form (valid/invalid), assert toast/error states and network responses.‚Äù*

### Documentation
- **Docstrings & Comments:** Use AI to add concise docstrings explaining component responsibilities, a11y choices, and validation flow.  
- **README & Page Copy:** Draft and refine section copy (hero, about, project case studies) for clarity and tone; ensure consistency with the codebase.  
- **Change notes:** On structural changes, generate short migration notes (what moved and why).

### Context-Aware Techniques
- **Provide context to AI:**  
  - File tree (or relevant subtree) and `package.json` dependencies.  
  - Zod schemas for forms/content to drive types, tests, and examples.  
  - Diff hunks for PR-sized modifications.  
  - Contentlayer config and MDX frontmatter to keep code/data aligned.  
- **API/Schema grounding:** When adding routes or external APIs, paste the schema/OpenAPI snippet so AI can produce typed helpers and contract tests.

### Analytics & Performance

#### Vercel Web Analytics 
- Enable in Vercel dashboard
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package
- Rendered `<Analytics />` in the root layout
- Verify in production/preview: Look for requests to `/_vercel/insights/view`

### Performance Optimizations

- **Images**:
  - All images use Next.js Image component with proper aspect ratios
  - Responsive `sizes` attribute for optimal loading
  - Placeholder UI for images while loading
  
- **Layout Stability**:
  - Fixed aspect ratio containers prevent layout shifts
  - Properly sized images prevent reflows
  - Consistent spacing and grid layouts

#### Vercel Speed Insights
- Enable in Vercel dashboard
- Added `@vercel/speed-insights` package
- Rendered `<SpeedInsights />` in the root layout
- Verify in production/preview: Look for `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js`
  - Note: No data collection in development mode

#### Privacy Protection
- Uses `beforeSend` to filter sensitive routes:
  - Excludes `/admin` paths
  - Redacts URLs containing `?token=` or `&token=`
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected
- Data collection is limited to production deployments

#### Plausible Integration
- Running alongside Vercel Analytics for complementary insights
- Privacy-focused visitor analytics
- No cookies or persistent identifiers

### Step 5 ‚Äî A11y & Design Polish
- Skip link for keyboard users and main content landmark
- Consistent layout primitives: `Container` and `Section`
- Global focus-visible outlines using theme ring token
- Minimal prose-like MDX styles (light/dark) without extra plugins
- Reduced-motion support
- External link safety (`rel="noopener noreferrer"`)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Run

### Environment
Create `.env.local` from `.env.local.example` and fill:
- `RESEND_API_KEY` ‚Äî Resend API key
- `CONTACT_TO` ‚Äî the destination email for contact messages
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` ‚Äî Upstash Redis REST URL (for rate limiting)
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` ‚Äî Upstash Redis REST token (for rate limiting)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN` ‚Äî if set, loads Plausible analytics script; leave blank to disable locally.

> For development, the API uses `onboarding@resend.dev` as the sender.

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### API Types
- Generate types from the OpenAPI spec:
  ```bash
  npm run generate:api:types
  ```

### Changelog
- Uses Conventional Commits
- Update with: `npm run changelog`

---

### Continuous Integration
- GitHub Actions runs on push/PR to `main`:
  - content build ‚Üí typecheck ‚Üí lint ‚Üí unit tests ‚Üí Playwright e2e
- Dummy env vars are used in CI so the Contact API module loads:
  - `RESEND_API_KEY=dummy`
  - `CONTACT_TO=test@example.com`
- On e2e failure, the Playwright report is uploaded as a build artifact.

## üöÄ Deployment
